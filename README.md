# Emergent Behavoirs (AI)

<a href='https://godotengine.org/'>Godot</a> is a video game engine, similar to Unreal or Unity.  This project is my Godot adaptation of some of the ideas found in the books <a href='https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-game-ai/9781556220784/'>Programming Game AI by Example</a> and <a href='https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/'>Game Programming Patterns</a>. It is written in GDScript, a language similar to Python.  All artwork was made by either me or my lovely wife.

<br>
Each AI behavior arises from simple rules, mostly based around manipulating Physics Vectors and performing efficient calculations. The project contains 6 examples in total.
<br>
<br>
Creating Game AI is more than using lots of IF statements, it's about creating Emergent Behaviors that arise from a simple set of rules.  The basis for most of this comes from Craig Reynolds "Boids" program, written in 1986.
<br>
<br>
In the following videos I've shown samples that highlight some of the AI patterns, specifically:
<ul>
<li>Path Following w/ Obstacle Avoidance</li>
<li>Emergent Behavoirs - Flocking</li>
<li>Leader Following</li>
</ul>
